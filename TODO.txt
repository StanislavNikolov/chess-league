  [3] - maybe also add a login button?
  [3] - Add timer to live games.
  [2] - Add sandboxing for the dotnet process

Requested by users:
- Lite Blue:
  1) Doesn't seem like I can see my bots in the Your Bots section
  2) Rename Human Leaderboard to Dev Leaderboard
  3) Add ability to edit Bot and User data
  4) I would recommend using an opening book for the games so that engines don't keep playing the same game over and over again
