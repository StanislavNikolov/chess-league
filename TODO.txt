High:
  - Optimize the query in backend/arena.ts: pickBotByNumberOfGamesPlayed.
    It counts the number of games played by each bot, and then picks a bot.
    Takes 200ms, should be more like 2ms.
  - Developer page, list a dev's bots

Mid:
  - Add "fen" string view on the game page
  - Add token count to each bot in the db
  - When you click on a bots profile, if they are currently in a game, that game should be shown live at the top of the site.

Low:
  - Make the timer update if you leave the page open overnight.
  - Maybe optimize with websockets?
