High:
    - Optimize the query in backend/arena.ts: pickBotByNumberOfGamesPlayed.
      It counts the number of games played by each bot, and then picks a bot.
      Takes 200ms, should be more like 2ms.

Mid:
  - Add "fen" string view on the game page
  - Add token count to each bot in the db
  - Optimzie the renderer in the live games page

Low:
  - Make the timer update if you leave the page open overnight.
  - Maybe optimize with websockets?
